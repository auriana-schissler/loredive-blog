## Loredive - Let's Write This Together!

Hi everyone! I'm Auriana, and this is going to be my journey developing a new creative writing platform -- Loredive.

### About me
As a little bit of background, I'm a professional software developer, systems admin, and DBA in the Microsoft world for about 11 years now, and I use my personal projects as a reason to learn new technologies I otherwise wouldn't be seeing. 

My last project was the [FFXIV Toolkit](https://ffxiv-toolkit.com) to give a simple parsing tool for the Final Fantasy XIV roleplay community, and a lot of the future ideas I had for it ended up fueling this project instead.

### What are we going to be working toward?
I'm going to be a bit ambitious here, but I don't work in half measures. Over time, we're going to be shooting for 4 main features:
- The ability for a user to organize their various writings
- The ability for multiple users to share and collaborate writings ad hoc or in guilds
- Automatic discovery of references to characters, locations, etc.
- The ability to publish writings in various ways and formats

### What will this blog be for?
We won't be going step by step through the entire development process, but I will be documenting good learning opportunities for various technologies. These will usually be collections of resources I found to figure out a problem, but the goal will always be to convey these learning opportunities as simply as possible. 

### What languages and software is going to be used?
Currently the plan is for the frontend to use React with Typescript, the backend will be in Rust, media will be provided with Azure storage, and all other data will utilize PostgreSQL.


See you on the other side!
